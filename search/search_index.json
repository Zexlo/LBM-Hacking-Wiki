(Eg: \"Are all the ghosts in this wave captured yet?\", \"Is flag 23 turned on?\").  Think of them like an invisible eye that consistently monitors what condition needs to be met so that something can be done.</p> <p>They are used for everything from making ghosts spawn to making the lights turn on when you've captured all the ghosts in a room.</p> <p>Let's look at an example:</p> <p> diagram</p> <pre><code>graph LR\nA[Start] --&gt; B{All ghosts caught?};\nB --&gt;|No| C[Go back to start];\nC --&gt; A;\nB ----&gt;|Yes| E[Turn on lights];</code></pre> <ol> <li>The observer will ask the game a \"question\" (Eg: \"Have all the candles in this room been blown out?\") - In programming terms these \"questions\" are known as Conditions.</li> <li>The game itself will reply with an \"answer\" of either True (Yes) or False (No). - In programming terms these \"answers\" are known as bool's / Booleans.</li> <li>If the reply from the game is True (Yes) then the observer will do something - More accurately, it will do whatever is specified in the observer's do_type field.</li> </ol> <p>By using the cond_string_arg0 and string_arg0 fields in the observers you can link a multiple observers to activate after just one observer activates,</p> <p>this will allow you to do more than just one thing after a ghost wave has been defeated for example.</p> <p>You could however also create a \"observer chain\" to do this; \"Is all the ghosts in this wave captured yet?\" (True) -&gt; Light Up The Room (True) -&gt; Unlock The Doors (True) -&gt; Spawn Chest (True)</p> <p>\"There's multiple ways to Rome\" - You can get similar results with different approaches, we recommend you choose one that you find the most understandable / easy to use.</p> <p>And that is essentially how all observers in the game work.</p> <p>Now go experiment! - That's the best way of learning! :)</p>"},{"location":"tools/","title":"Main page","text":"<p>Below is a list of Luigi's Mansion modding tools and related programs.

If a JMP entry doesn't require an appear_flag, disappear_flag, EventFlag, etc. value, then it will use 0 as a value. Which means, if you enable this flag, almost all JMP entries will be disabled! It's best to leave this flag alone. 1 map2 characterinfo, eventinfo, objinfo, observerinfo, teidencharacterinfo event01 0x8674 0x32364 N/A Turned on at the end of event01. This disables the event from happening again, enables the Foyer Toad cutscene event17, enables the falling behavior for the Foyer Chandelier due to move type 20, and makes the event01 Parlor cutscene models disappear. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. 2 map2 characterinfo event85, event96 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event96 when Luigi has collected 20 or more Boos. This flag disables event85 and the bmtelesa model in the Attic hallway. 3 map2 characterinfo, eventinfo, keyinfo event48 0x8684, 0x18CFC 0x18BFC N/A Turned on with ASM once Luigi attempts to open the Parlor doors on a new save file and activates event07. This flag will make sure the ASM that plays the ghost laughter sound effect and turns on the flag won't execute again. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. 4 map2 characterinfo, eventinfo, keyinfo event07 0x868C N/A N/A Turned on at the end of event07, disabling all of the cutscene models needed for event07, but it also enables dluige01 for event01. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. 5 N/A N/A event08, event26 0x8694 N/A N/A When on, this flag allows the Hidden Mansion option to appear in event08. This flag is automatically turned on if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. 6 map3 eventinfo event08, event26 0x869C N/A N/A Turned on in event08 when the player selects the Training Room option in event08. It makes event10 load instead of event09 in the Training Room. This flag is automatically turned on if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. 7 N/A N/A event02, event08, event26, event28 0x86A4 0x9BD0 N/A Turned on in event08 after E. Gadd gives his initial lecture to Luigi, preventing that part of event08 from happening again. Once this flag is on, ASM will execute that switches the cutscene when loading into the main game mode from the prologue cutscene to the E. Gadd waving cutscene. Nintendo put (7) into a few other events, but the one that matters is in event08. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. 8 N/A N/A event08 (PAL) N/A N/A N/A Flag 8 is unused. In the PAL version it's turned off in the beginning of event08, and then turned on when going to the Hidden Mansion. It seems that Nintendo was originally using this flag to prevent the Lab from flipping in Hidden Mansion mode, but they settled on an ASM Event tag fix instead. 9 N/A N/A event02, event28 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event02 after Luigi has been through the initial explanation of the Portrificationizer machine from E. Gadd. This flag prevents this explanation from occurring again and also removes the Angel Statue requirement from event28 in the Gallery. 10 map2 eventinfo event04, event17, event45, event94 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event45 to disable the Blackout phone sequence: event92, event93, and event94. If Luigi completes the sequence, then this flag will be turned on early at the end of event94. This flag also gives the Courtyard and Foyer Toads: event04 and event17 respectively, new dialogue about the Blackout. 11 map2 eventinfo, teidenobserverinfo event92, event93 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event92 just outside the Telephone Room door, which enables the first phone to ring in the center of the Telephone Room. Once Luigi picks the phone up in event93, this flag is turned off. 12 map2 eventinfo N/A 0xACE90 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM after collecting the Wardrobe Room key. This flag activates event15 so that E. Gadd can warn Luigi about Portrait Ghosts before finding Neville. 13 map2 eventinfo event36, event37 N/A N/A N/A Turned on at the end of event36 once Madame Clairvoya's heart has been exposed. This flag makes sure that event36 and event37 never happen again. 14 map2 eventinfo, keyinfo, observerinfo N/A N/A N/A N/A Turned on with an observer in the Parlor once Luigi extinguishes all the candles in the room. This flag activates event61 so that the Paintings can talk to Luigi. 15 map2 eventinfo event29 0x72424 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM once the player has captured a Boo, activating event29 and starting the E. Gadd Boo call. 16 N/A N/A event63 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event63 after Luigi has said Don't worry about it! to the Toad in the F1 Washroom. This flag will make the Toad's dialogue faster upon revisiting. 17 map6 furnitureinfo event28, event77 0x86AC, 0x140B94(0x14A078) N/A N/A Turned on when tapping the Angel Statues in the Gallery due to move type 43 in furnitureinfo. It can also be turned on in event77 after scanning the statues with the GBH. The player will not be allowed to progress in event28 until this flag is on. This flag is automatically turned on with ASM if playing on a save file that has been cleared at least once. Turned on with ASM when sucking up the unused yarn ball actor okeito1 due to an unused vacuum effect type. It is not actually possible to suck up okeito1. 18 map2 characterinfo, enemyinfo, furnitureinfo, objinfo event25 0x3441C 0x343D0 N/A Turned on with ASM tied to event25, but Nintendo put it inside of event25 too just to be safe. This flag swaps furnitureinfo, enemyinfo, and objinfo entries, removes the chest on the ceiling, and acts as a reminder for the game to swap the Guest Room archive from room_28.arc to room28A.arc and flip the mirror in the room after resetting the game so that the room is properly flipped upon revisit. 19 map2 eventinfo event51 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event51 and disables event31 from happening again. If Luigi mirror warps to the Foyer and walks up to the Nursery, event31 will not play at all due to event51 being activated first. 20 N/A N/A event36 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event36 once Madame Clairvoya has verified that flag 21 is on. This will count Mario's Glove as \"checked\" and will prevent her from reviewing it a second time. 21 map2 eventinfo event36 0xCD910 enitem_mglove.prm N/A N/A Turned on via ASM and parameter file when the player collects Mario's Glove, which activates event41. Madame Clairvoya will check this flag in event36 to confirm that Luigi has collected the glove. Flag 22 is unused. 23 N/A N/A event36 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event36 once Madame Clairvoya has verified that flag 24 is on. This will count Mario's Shoe as \"checked\" and will prevent her from reviewing it a second time. 24 map2 eventinfo event36 0xCD910 enitem_mshoe.prm N/A N/A Turned on via ASM and parameter file when the player collects Mario's Shoe, which activates event18. Madame Clairvoya will check this flag in event36 to confirm that Luigi has collected the glove. Flag 25 is unused. 26 N/A N/A event36 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event36 once Madame Clairvoya has verified that flag 27 is on. This will count Mario's Letter as \"checked\" and will prevent her from reviewing it a second time. 27 map2 eventinfo event36 0xCD910 enitem_mletter.prm N/A N/A Turned on via ASM and parameter file when the player collects Mario's Letter, which activates event19. Madame Clairvoya will check this flag in event36 to confirm that Luigi has collected the glove. Flag 28 is unused. 29 N/A N/A event36 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event36 once Madame Clairvoya has verified that flag 30 is on. This will count Mario's Star as \"checked\" and will prevent her from reviewing it a second time. 30 map2 eventinfo event36 0xCD910 enitem_mstar.prm N/A N/A Turned on via ASM and parameter file when the player collects Mario's Star, which activates event20. Madame Clairvoya will check this flag in event36 to confirm that Luigi has collected the glove. Flag 31 is unused. 32 N/A N/A event36 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event36 once Madame Clairvoya has verified that flag 33 is on. This will count Mario's Hat as \"checked\" and will prevent her from reviewing it a second time. 33 map2 eventinfo event36 0xCD910 enitem_mcap.prm N/A N/A Turned on via ASM and parameter file when the player collects Mario's Hat, which activates event21. Madame Clairvoya will check this flag in event36 to confirm that Luigi has collected the glove. Flag 34 is unused. 35 map2 characterinfo event08, event26, event27 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event08 after Luigi releases the Boos in the Storage Room, spawning Shivers the Butler in the F1 Hallway. Nintendo also turned this flag on in event27, although it is unnecessary. 36 map2 eventinfo N/A 0x675A4, 0x67648 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM when Sue Pea has been defeated, allowing event25 to activate and \"flip\" the Guest Room with sound effects. 37 map2 eventinfo event13, event24 N/A N/A N/A Turned on at the end of event24 after Luigi agrees to play Hide and Seek with the Twins. This flag activates event13, but for some reason, Nintendo also decided to turn this flag on in event13 as well.. 38 map2 characterinfo, eventinfo, observerinfo event25, event77 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event25, activating an observer in the Guest Room that places the correct chest on the floor. For some bizarre reason, Nintendo decided to use this as a disappear_flag for Miss Petunia. 39 map2 eventinfo event11, event42, event80 0xACE78 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM once Luigi collects Chauncey's heart key. This flag is used in the after-boss E. Gadd call events to determine proper dialogue. 40 map2 observerinfo event33 0x9A960 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM after Jarvis has been defeated. Prevents his event, event33, from running again. 41 map2 eventinfo, furnitureinfo N/A N/A 0x34578 N/A Turned on when Luigi presses the first button in the Storage Room due to move type 33. The sliding wall, using move type 12, detects that this flag has been turned on and will move. This flag also acts as a reminder for the game to remove the collision for the wall after a reset, so that the room is properly cleared upon revisit. 42 N/A N/A event32 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event32 once Luigi has listened to the F2 Balcony Toad's dialogue at least once. This flag will make the Toad's dialogue faster upon revisiting. 43 map2 eventinfo N/A 0xCF470(0xCF564) N/A N/A Turned on with ASM once Luigi has collected the Fire Medal, which activates event54. 44 map2 eventinfo N/A 0xCF470(0xCF574) N/A N/A Turned on with ASM once Luigi has collected the Water Medal, which activates event70. 45 map2 eventinfo N/A 0xCF470(0xCF56C) N/A N/A Turned on with ASM once Luigi has collected the Ice Medal, which activates event12. 46 map2 characterinfo, eventinfo, observerinfo, teidencharacterinfo event67, event77 0x9B340 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM after Chauncey has been defeated. This flag will be detected by an observer in the Nursery and turn the lights on, disable/enable some actors, and disable the event77 GBH scanbox dialogue connected to the Heart Boss Doors. It is also used in event67 to warp Luigi back to the Nursery. map10 eventinfo 47 map2 eventinfo N/A 0x101950 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM after the player hits Chauncey with the ball in the Nursery. This activates event50 so Chauncey can talk to Luigi. 48 N/A N/A N/A 0xD3748(0xD3740) 0xD3B0C, 0xD3B58, 0xD3B80 N/A Turned on with ASM once Luigi waters the Boneyard plant in Area 4. Once flags 48, 78, and 79 are all on, the plant will throw up large amounts of treasure. 49 map2 eventinfo, observerinfo N/A 0x34544 0x34484, 0x34544, 0x17F140 N/A Turned on with ASM after Luigi has looked through the telescope in the Observatory. An observer detects when this flag is turned on and activates the SPACE soundobj. This flag also acts as a reminder for the game to remove the collision for the Observatory wall and add the boundaries around the wooden plank upon reset, so that the room is halfway cleared upon revisit. The Shining Ghost generator star will also become active once this flag is ON due to ASM. 50 map2 eventinfo event68 0x344D0 0x34464, 0x344B4, 0x17F004, 0x17F11C N/A Turned on with ASM when Luigi destroys the moon in the Observatory, activating the second part of event68 so that Luigi looks at the Rainbow Bridge when it spawns. This flag also acts as a reminder for the game to remove the collision for the Observatory wall, remove the boundaries around the wooden plank, and add the collision for the Rainbow Bridge upon reset, so that the room is properly cleared upon revisit. The Shining Ghost generator star will also become inactive once this flag is ON due to ASM. 51 map2 characterinfo N/A 0x1100A8 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM after the Twins have been defeated. This flag disables the cutscene versions of the Twins, dboy and dboy2. 52 map2 eventinfo event68 N/A N/A N/A Turned on at the end of event68. This flag prevents the Observatory cutscenes from replaying. 53 N/A N/A event04, event46 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event46 once Luigi has seen Mario in the Secret Altar painting for the first time. This flag will make event46 faster upon revisiting and also allows the Courtyard Toad in event04 to save the game. 54 map2 observerinfo event04 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event04 after Luigi has said Leave it to me! to the Toad in the Courtyard. This will change the Toad's dialogue to helpful hints about Mario's dropped items. 55 map2 furnitureinfo N/A 0x9A488 0x338F4 N/A Turned on with ASM after Vincent Van Gore has been defeated. This flag executes ASM that disables the effects of move type 39. 56 map2 eventinfo event29 0xAC838 0x18D14 N/A Turned on with ASM after Luigi catches 5 Boos, but is also turned on in event29 for the same reason. This flag disables event47 and executes ASM code that unlocks the F1 Washroom door. The ASM for turning this flag ON does not exist in the Japanese version. 57 map2 observerinfo event45 N/A N/A N/A Turned on in event45, activating an observer in the Breaker Room that spawns the chest. 58 N/A N/A event09, event10 N/A N/A N/A Turned on several times in event09 and event10. If Luigi somehow dies in the Training Room, he will get scolded by E. Gadd who remembers that Luigi died thanks to this flag. 59 map2 eventinfo event65 N/A N/A N/A This flag effectively splits event65 into two parts. When this flag is off, the event knows to play the cutscene where Bogmire's tombstone begins to glow, turning this flag on in the process. When this flag is on, then the event knows to play the cutscene where Bogmire spawns out of the tombstone. Flag 60 is unused. 61 map2 event04, event32, event44, event63, event77, event78 0x3464C, 0x14A1F0 0x3460C 0x34658 Turned on in event44 but also turned on automatically with ASM when  is used. This flag executes ASM that turns off all lights in the map. When ON event92 activates, allowing the Blackout phone call sequence to activate. Some Toads gain new dialogue after this flag has been turned on, and the \"You know, I never noticed how lovely those red polka dots look on top!\" GBH scan message in event77 will be permanently disabled. Turned on with ASM when the unused actor okeito1 becomes active after being vacuumed. 62 map2 characterinfo, observerinfo N/A 0x101E94 N/A N/A Turned on with ASM after Neville has been defeated.

The Toad in the Foyer using event17 uses it to speed up the dialogue if Luigi first chose \"Good-bye.\" Sue Pea will turn this flag on with ASM every time she yawns by being doused, and will immediately turn it back off when she lies back down.
